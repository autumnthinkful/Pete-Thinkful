    <p> After graduating college, I became an art teacher and worked with beginners and professionals. I love art and my works have been featured in major art galleries across the globe.</p>
          <p> If you're looking to hire an artist or if you're an artist looking for a collaborator for your next project, please reach out! I'm so excited to work with other artists to create new art.</p>
